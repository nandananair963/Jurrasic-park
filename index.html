            <p id="jp">Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous is an American animated science fiction action-adventure streaming television series developed by Zack Stentz. Based on the novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, the series debuted on Netflix on September 18, 2020, as part of the Jurassic Park franchise, and is set before, during, and after the events of the film Jurassic World. It stars Paul-Mik√©l Williams, Sean Giambrone, Kausar Mohammed, Jenna Ortega, Ryan Potter, and Raini Rodriguez as six teenagers who become stranded on Isla Nublar after multiple dinosaurs escape their habitats. Jameela Jamil, Glen Powell, Stephanie Beatriz, Bradley Whitford, and Angus Sampson also star in recurring roles, and the series features music composed by Leo Birenberg.<br>
Following its first season's release, the show was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics, who applauded the animation and diverse voice cast but criticized the show's character designs and writing. In October 2020, a second season was announced that premiered on January 22, 2021. In March, a third ten-episode season was teased that is scheduled to be released on May 21, 2021. Aaron Hammersley and Scott Kreamer both serve as showrunners for the series, executive-producing along Lane Lueras, Steven Spielberg, Colin Trevorrow, and Frank Marshall.</p>
